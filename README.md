This is my final year project on Numerical algorithms in image processing. You can first read the PowerPoint to gain a better understanding of the Chan-Vese model.

If you wish to try it, you can download the Python file and modify the picture's location. Subsequently, you can segment your picture.

If you would like more information about this project, please contact me via email at crosseee1@gmail.com.
